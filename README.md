Typing Test

Description: This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a webpage for typing tests and typing training. Additionally, the website has stats and achievements pages to track the user's progress.

Use: To use this program, download the git repository on your local machine, and open the index.html file in your browser of choice. Users can choose to participate in either timed tests, or word-limited tests. Both have a variety of options determining the length of the test, whether that be in time or words. Training can be completed on full words, or the upper row, middle row, bottom row, number key, or punctuation. If the user sets a personal record in one of the defined stats, the stats page will update. Similarly if the user attains an achievement, the achievements page will update.
